# CFBD Scorebot Admin - Development Plan

## Executive Summary
The CFBD Scorebot Admin is a Discord bot configuration interface for college football game broadcasts. The application works well but has some developer quality of life issues and opportunities for user experience improvements.

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… **Strengths**
- **Core functionality complete**: Full Discord bot configuration workflow
- **Modern tech stack**: Nuxt 3, Vue 3 Composition API, PrimeVue, Express, TypeScript
- **Production ready**: Docker containers with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Database architecture**: Well-structured PostgreSQL with Kysely ORM
- **User experience**: Clean, intuitive interface with real-time updates

### ðŸ”§ **Developer Pain Points**
- **Type safety issues**: 13 `@ts-ignore` statements causing development friction
- **No local testing**: Manual testing only, slows down development iterations
- **Error handling**: Generic error responses make debugging difficult
- **Development setup**: Could be more streamlined for future contributors

### ðŸŽ¯ **User Enhancement Opportunities**
- **Better game discovery**: Search, filtering, and sorting for large game lists
- **Configuration management**: Save/load presets, bulk operations
- **Visual improvements**: Better mobile experience, loading states
- **Discord integration**: Enhanced bot message previews

  - Simple backup/restore functionality

## Implementation Strategy

### **Start Small, Iterate Fast**
1. **Week 1-2**: Fix TypeScript issues, basic error handling
2. **Week 3-4**: Add basic tests, improve development setup
3. **Week 5-6**: Game filtering and search functionality
4. **Week 7-8**: Configuration presets and bulk operations
5. **Week 9-10**: Mobile improvements and visual polish
6. **Week 11-12**: Bot message previews and Discord enhancements

### **Development Principles**
- **Pragmatic over perfect**: Focus on features that provide immediate value
- **User feedback driven**: Implement based on actual user pain points
- **Developer efficiency**: Tools and improvements that speed up future development
- **Incremental deployment**: Small, frequent releases rather than big bang updates

### **Success Metrics (Simplified)**
- **Developer productivity**: Faster iteration cycles, fewer debugging sessions
- **User satisfaction**: Reduced support requests, positive feedback
- **Code maintainability**: Easier to add new features without breaking existing functionality
- **Stability**: Fewer user-reported bugs and errors

### **Timeline**
- **Total duration**: 3-4 months of part-time work
- **Core improvements**: First 6-8 weeks
- **Polish and enhancements**: Remaining time based on priorities
- **Continuous**: Small improvements and bug fixes as needed

This plan focuses on practical improvements that make the application more enjoyable to develop and use, without over-engineering for scale that may never be needed.
